Potential Bonus Marks:
Attempted to add a sheild feature. The sheild would randomly be generated on the screen.
Once the ship intersects with the sheild it will attach to the ship. The sheild works
by blocking one potential asteroid collision. Once the sheild intersects with an asteroid 
it will destroy both itself and the asteroid and the ship can continue playing.
