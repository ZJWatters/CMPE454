Ray Tracing assignment.
A4.txt outlines the code written by me.

Below is taken from A4.txt written by the professor.
In the raytracing window

  As long as you're dragging the mouse to shift the viewpoint, the
  scene will be redrawn quickly using OpenGL.  As soon as you stop
  dragging the mouse, the raytracing code is called, and eventually a
  raytraced image is shown.  You can drag the mouse again while the
  raytracing is being done; the raytracing will be restarted as soon
  as you stop dragging.

  Note that the raytracing pixels are 2x2 normal pixels (controlled by
  PIXEL_SCALE in scene.h).  This is to show the effects of antialiasing.
  You might want to set PIXEL_SCALE to 4 when debugging your
  antialiasing to make the effect more visible.  You can also use
  CTRL-left mouse to zoom in on pixels.

  In the rendering window, press '?' to get a list of options in the
  console window.  These options allow you to change many things,
  including the glossiness and the number of sample rays.

  Click the mouse on a pixel to see the rays traced through that
  pixel.  You can use the right mouse button to rotate the scene to
  see the rays from a different viewpoint.  The rays are coloured:

    blue:   a ray that hit an object
    grey:   a ray that did not hit an object
    yellow: a shadow ray that was sent toward a point light source
