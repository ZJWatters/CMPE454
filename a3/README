A3.txt file outlines code that was written by me.

The sphere/sphere collisions were done in two ways. The current one is using the code steps. The 2nd is commented out right below. Under the comment
'/* sphere velocities done using components' is the method for sphere/sphere 
collisions using the individual perpendicular and parrallel components. 
To see this method (which i think looks more realistic) comment out the first one and uncomment the 2nd. 

For binary search the while condition (interval > deltaT/128.0) can be updated to be more accurate by dividing by a large number. 
I chose 128 becasue my computer is too slow to watch the simultion without lagging if it is much higher.

Sim video is a recording of the simulation using 'test2' file in the Command Aurguments. 
When 'c' is pressed the simulation shows the closest point of contact on the spheres path. 
Spheres that turn green are constrained to roll on the plane.
